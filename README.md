### Projects
#### 1. Citi Bike Data Analysis
An exploratory analysis of New York City's Citi Bike trip data, examining user behavior patterns, station usage, and trip trends to inform operational improvements.

**Key Technologies:** Google BigQuery, SQL, Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn), Looker Studio
Highlights:
- Trip pattern analysis by user type
- Busiest station identification
- Temporal trend analysis (daily/hourly patterns)
- Interactive dashboard for key metrics

#### 2. Flight Diversion Prediction
An analytical project using machine learning to predict U.S. flight diversions, aiming to minimize operational disruptions, optimize resource allocation, and reduce associated costs for airlines and airports.

**Key Technologies:** Google BigQuery, SQL, Python (google-cloud-bigquery, pandas), BigQuery ML
Highlights:
- Development of baseline, engineered, localized, and cost-optimized ML models
- Identification of an optimal cost-based decision threshold
- Significant recall improvements through feature engineering and subgroup specialization
