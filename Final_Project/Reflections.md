**Project Contributions**

In the Wildfire Analytics project, my primary contributions spanned model development, project structuring, and presentation support, particularly during the early and middle stages of the project. At the beginning of the project, I was responsible for building the initial predictive models, including both regression and classification models to estimate wildfire-related outcomes. I handled the feature selection, model setup, and initial evaluation, which helped the team establish a baseline understanding of how different environmental variables influenced wildfire risk and severity. Although these models were later modified and replaced by alternative approaches as the project evolved, my early work played a key role in defining the modeling direction and validating that a data-driven approach was feasible for our dataset. In addition to modeling, I took the lead in developing the overall presentation structure and narrative flow. I drafted the front sections of the slides, including the project background, problem framing, data overview, and analytical roadmap. This framework helped ensure that the project told a coherent story—from real-world wildfire challenges to technical implementation and business impact—rather than appearing as disconnected technical components. I also actively participated in the final presentation, supporting the explanation of analytical choices, results interpretation, and project implications. Throughout the process, I collaborated closely with my teammates, incorporated feedback, and adjusted my work to align with the evolving needs of the group.

**Key Highlights**

One key highlight of my contribution was my ability to translate a complex real-world problem into an analytical modeling task. By designing both regression and classification approaches early on, I helped the team explore multiple perspectives on wildfire prediction and risk assessment. Another highlight was my role in project storytelling and structure. Rather than focusing only on individual technical components, I emphasized clarity, logical flow, and audience understanding—skills that are critical when presenting analytics results to non-technical stakeholders.

**Learning Outcomes and Reflection**

This project strengthened my understanding of end-to-end analytics workflows, especially the reality that models often evolve, get replaced, or are improved through team collaboration. I learned that early-stage modeling is still highly valuable, even if it does not appear in the final deliverable, because it shapes direction, uncovers data limitations, and informs better decisions later in the project. Additionally, the experience reinforced the importance of communication and adaptability in team-based analytics projects. Being open to changes, supporting teammates, and prioritizing the overall project outcome over individual ownership were critical to our success. Overall, this project deepened my technical skills in predictive modeling while also enhancing my ability to contribute strategically to team-based, real-world data science initiatives.

**Project Contributions**

In the Wildfire Alert System project, I contributed to building the batch layer to load historical wildfire data from Kaggle into BigQuery, establishing the data foundation for model training. I developed both the Logistic Regression classification model for fire severity prediction and the Gradient Boosted Tree regression model for acreage estimation, including feature engineering. When linear regression underperformed, I shifted to boosted trees and implemented 99th percentile capping to handle outliers, improving mean absolute error. I also helped set up the streaming layer to pull real-time weather data from the Open-Meteo API through Cloud Functions and Pub/Sub. I designed the Looker Studio dashboard that visualizes predictions across California through heatmaps, KPI cards, and risk distribution charts. Finally, I developed presentation slides explaining model choices and technical decisions to stakeholders.

**Key Highlights**

Transitioning from linear regression to Gradient Boosted Trees showed how choosing the right model directly impacts operational performance. Building the full system from data pipelines through modeling to visualization gave me a practical understanding of how analytics systems work in production.

**Learning Outcomes**

This project taught me that model development is iterative. The first approach often isn't the best—testing alternatives and learning from failures drives better decisions. I also learned that technical work and clear communication are equally important. A good model that stakeholders don't understand has limited value. Every technical decision should align with what users actually need. This experience strengthened my ability to work on complex projects while keeping the end-user impact in focus.
