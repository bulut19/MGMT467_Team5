        "\n",
        "- **Capping FIRE_SIZE at the 99th Percentile (LEAST(FIRE_SIZE, {fire_size_99th_percentile}) AS target_fire_size):** As we observed in the distribution analysis, wildfire sizes have extreme outliers. A small percentage of very large fires can disproportionately influence a regression model, causing it to perform poorly on the vast majority of smaller, more common fires. Capping the target variable at the 99th percentile helps the model focus on predicting typical fire sizes more accurately, making it more robust and preventing it from being unduly skewed by rare, massive events.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Interaction Term (Temp_cont * Hum_cont AS temp_humidity_interaction):** Fire behavior is often driven not just by individual weather factors, but by how they combine. For example, high temperature and low humidity together (dry heat) create much more severe conditions than either factor alone. This interaction term allows the model to capture these synergistic effects, improving its ability to understand the complex relationship between environmental conditions and fire spread.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Fire Danger Index ((Temp_cont * (100 - Hum_cont) * Wind_cont) / 1000 AS fire_danger_index):** This is a custom-engineered feature designed to aggregate critical weather components into a single metric representing overall fire potential. It combines temperature (higher temperature, higher risk), relative humidity (lower humidity, higher risk, hence 100 - Hum_cont), and wind speed (higher wind, higher risk). Dividing by 1000 is for scaling. This index provides the model with a consolidated signal of fire danger, potentially capturing insights that individual features might miss.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Geographic Features (ABS(LATITUDE - 40) AS latitude_deviation_from_40, CASE WHEN LONGITUDE BETWEEN -125 AND -115 AND LATITUDE BETWEEN 30 AND 45 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS coast_region):** Fire regimes and behavior vary significantly by geography, even under similar weather.\n",
        "- **latitude_deviation_from_40:** This captures how far north or south a fire is relative to a central latitude. Different latitudes in California can have distinct vegetation types, precipitation patterns, and seasonal fire risks. The absolute difference from 40 (roughly central California) helps the model understand latitudinal zones without assuming a linear increase/decrease.\n",
        "- **coast_region:** Coastal areas often have different vegetation (e.g., chaparral, coastal sage scrub), humidity levels (influenced by ocean), and wind patterns (sea breezes) compared to inland regions. This binary feature provides the model with crucial information about proximity to the coast, which is a known factor in wildfire dynamics."

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Assumptions Section:**\n",
        "    *   **Data Availability and Quality:** Assumes historical Kaggle data is representative and clean, and the Open-Meteo API is continuously accessible, accurate, free, and stable, providing sufficient real-time weather data (hourly frequency, sufficient spatial granularity).\n",
        "    *   **Model Performance Stability and Retraining:** Assumes stable underlying patterns for wildfire behavior, maintained predictive accuracy of Boosted Tree Regression and Logistic Regression models, and the presence of a periodic (e.g., monthly) model retraining mechanism.\n",
        "    *   **Operational Environment:** Assumes high reliability, availability, and performance of GCP services (Cloud Storage, BigQuery, Pub/Sub, Cloud Functions, Dataflow, Cloud Scheduler, Cloud Run/Artifact Registry), stable network connectivity, adequate resource limits, and sufficient standard GCP security measures.\n",
        "    *   **External Factors:** Assumes no abrupt shifts in climate patterns or human ignition patterns, and stability in emergency response frameworks.\n",
        "    *   **Impact of Violated Assumptions:** Highlights that false assumptions could lead to inaccurate predictions, system failures, decreased utility, and increased costs, underscoring the need for continuous monitoring.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Data Ethics Section:**\n",
        "    *   **Data Source Ethics:** Acknowledges potential historical biases in the Kaggle wildfire data (1992-2015) due to varying collection practices, which could embed inequities. For the Open-Meteo API, while privacy risk is low (public data), reliability, accuracy, and continuous availability are critical.\n",
        "    *   **ML Model Biases:** Notes that disproportionate representation in historical data (e.g., specific regions like California) could lead to model bias, resulting in less accurate or unfair predictions for underserved areas and potentially misallocating resources.\n",
        "    *   **Stakeholder Impact:** Identifies ethical implications for emergency response (resource misallocation), insurance (discriminatory pricing), government agencies (equitable budget allocation), and high-risk residents (alarm fatigue vs. undue risk, equitable information access).\n",
        "    *   **Transparency and Accountability:** Emphasizes the need for explainable AI (XAI) to understand model decisions, clear roles and responsibilities, regular audits, and mechanisms for addressing model errors or negative consequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Privacy/Security Notes Section:**\n",
        "    *   **Data Privacy:** Concludes that direct risk to individual privacy is inherently low, as both historical Kaggle data and real-time Open-Meteo API data are public and do not contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII).\n",
        "    *   **Data Security in GCP:** Highlights the implementation of GCP's robust security features, including rigorous IAM access controls, default encryption at rest (Google-managed keys) and in transit (TLS/SSL), secure network isolation via VPC, and secure managed environments for Cloud Functions and Dataflow.\n",
        "    *   **Overall System Security:** Addresses secure authentication for internal components and APIs (e.g., Cloud Scheduler with OIDC tokens), acknowledgment of supply chain security for third-party data providers, and the use of Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring for real-time security event detection.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Failure Playbook Section:**\n",
        "    *   **Key Failure Points:** Identifies four critical areas of potential failure:\n",
        "        1.  **API Outage (Open-Meteo):** Risk of stale or inaccurate real-time weather data.\n",
        "        2.  **Data Pipeline Breaks:** Interruptions in the flow through Cloud Functions, Pub/Sub, and Dataflow.\n",
        "        3.  **Model Drift:** Degradation of Boosted Tree Regression and Logistic Regression model performance over time.\n",
        "        4.  **BigQuery Infrastructure Failures:** Accidental deletion, permissions issues, or cost overruns.\n",
        "    *   **Structured Response:** For each failure point, the playbook outlines the expected impact, specific detection mechanisms (both automated via Cloud Monitoring/logs and manual checks), immediate mitigation steps, and long-term recovery protocols. This includes strategies like fallback mechanisms, code fixes, schema adjustments, model retraining, and BigQuery time travel or backups.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Proactive Bias Mitigation & Explainability:** Given the identified potential for historical data bias and the critical impact on stakeholders, prioritize implementing advanced techniques for bias detection and mitigation during model retraining, alongside exploring Explainable AI (XAI) methods to ensure predictions are not just accurate but also fair and justifiable.\n",
        "*   **Comprehensive Monitoring & Automated Alerts:** Leverage GCP's robust monitoring capabilities (Cloud Monitoring, Logging) to establish a comprehensive suite of automated alerts for all identified failure points (API status, pipeline health, model performance metrics, BigQuery health). This is crucial for early detection and rapid response outlined in the Failure Playbook.\n"
