## Refleciton

**Gabriel Wang(gabeunix): My technical contributions focused on ensuring data integrity and operationalizing the machine learning model. I developed a Python Cloud Function to manage the API data extraction and publishing process, while also configuring a Dataflow job for reliable streaming into BigQuery. During the deployment phase, I identified and resolved critical schema validation errors that were routing data to error tables, creating a fix for missing ingestion timestamps. To bridge the gap between live data availability and the model's historical training features, I engineered complex SQL queries that implemented persistence logic, allowing the Boosted Tree Regressor to output dynamic, realistic risk assessments based on immediate weather changes. This work culminated in a live Looker Studio dashboard that empowers stakeholders to visualize fire risk trends and predicted severity instantly.
