## Reflections

**Melisa Bulut (bulut19):** In this project, I contributed to several key stages of the data analysis process. I was involved in the initial exploration of the Citi Bike dataset, understanding its structure and contents, which led to the realization of notable data gaps, such as missing user type and station information. I actively participated in the hypothesis generation phase, leveraging AI to brainstorm potential business questions and selecting the most relevant ones to pursue. As documented in the AI prompt log, I engaged in an iterative process of refining prompts to obtain more specific and actionable SQL queries, moving beyond initial suggestions to arrive at the final analytical approach for each hypothesis. I also worked on the advanced SQL exploration, crafting and executing queries to test the hypotheses and extracting meaningful insights from the data. Furthermore, I collaborated on the synthesis of the findings and the development of actionable recommendations based on the analysis. Through this project, I deepened my understanding of querying large datasets in BigQuery, utilizing AI as a co-pilot in the analytical workflow, visualizing data to communicate findings, and translating data insights into practical business recommendations.

**Xinyi Zhang (joy86891):** In this project, I mainly worked on the visualization part using Google Colab, but I also learned a lot from reviewing and understanding the SQL queries. I explored how SQL was used to clean and aggregate the dataset before visualization, such as using functions like EXTRACT, GROUP BY, and COUNT to summarize trips by day, hour, or user type. This helped me see how raw data from BigQuery can be transformed into structured tables that are easier to visualize. On the visualization side, I created several charts in Colab using Matplotlib and Seaborn to show key trends such as trip duration and time distribution. I also created interactive Plotly versions of these visualizations to allow for better exploration of the data through hover effects and dynamic interactions. Through this process, I realized how SQL and visualization complement each other: SQL prepares and filters the data, while visualization communicates the insights clearly. I also learned the importance of choosing the right chart type, color, and labeling to make patterns easy to interpret. Overall, this project improved both my SQL understanding and my ability to use Python for effective data visualization with both static and interactive charts.
